<p class= "prgf1">My left donut is missing, as is my right it's 3am, time to create some chaos but destroy couch, and present belly, scratch hand when stroked you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me lick butt and make a weird face. Make meme, make cute face meowing non stop for food mrow so love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) climb leg, sniff sniff. Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. The door is opening! how exciting oh, it's you, meh. Cat not kitten around cereal boxes make for five star accommodation . Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out head nudges .
